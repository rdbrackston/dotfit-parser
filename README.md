# dotfit-parser
Project to parse and analyse .fit activity files.

The project is written python 3 and makes use of the Ant+ fit-SDK to perform the translation from .fit to .csv file format. The main source code is currently all within the fit_parser file, including utilities and an "activity" class definition.
